## What is Objectified

Objectified is a time-series dynamic schema object storage database that
uses PostgreSQL to store its data.

It uses REST services to programmatically provide CRUD services for 
data operations.

Schemas are programmatically defined, allowing for custom definitions of
objects, data fields, and data storage properties.

All of this is controlled and configured using a simple UI.

### How to build

You need the latest versions of node and yarn.

```shell
