refers to how this word was used hundreds and thousands of years ago: someone that seeks to help by means other 
  than conventional medical treatment. This may involve the use of herbs, minerals, crystals, and other natural 
  elements. It can certainly also involve the use of various energetic techniques, working with the quantum field, 
  the source, as well as specific frequencies and vibrations.
